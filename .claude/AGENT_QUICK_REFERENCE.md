# Agent Quick Reference Card
**Local Business CMS Framework**

## ðŸš€ **AUTOMATIC ROUTING ENABLED**

**You don't need to pick agents - just describe your task!**

The auto-router analyzes your request and invokes the correct specialist(s) automatically.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Just Say What You Want

**Examples (System routes automatically):**

```
You: "Add a warranty field to service schema"
â†’ System routes to sanity-cms-master âœ…

You: "Fix the mobile menu not closing"
â†’ System routes to frontend-developer-pro âœ…

You: "Run the tests"
â†’ System routes to test-writer-fixer âœ…

You: "Why is the homepage so slow?"
â†’ System routes to performance-benchmarker âœ…

You: "Deploy to production"
â†’ System routes to devops-automator âœ…
```

**Multi-step tasks? Also automatic:**

```
You: "Add a blog feature"
â†’ System chains: sanity-cms-master â†’ frontend-developer-pro
   â†’ test-writer-fixer â†’ devops-automator âœ…
```
